# hello-world

Hi there!

It's my first time to see you in this way. You've just created me!
it's just a very little step of your code-learning odyssey, but cheer up! With interest and efforts, you are gonna made itÔºÅ 

actually you are just a bit boring, and don't want to study for a while. make your time count!

(as it always refered in IT)
i've just get a little bit of the basic function. following the tutorial now i can create a branch, make contrasts and emerge it into the marster. with little more time to get on, maybe i can keep recording my everyday progress on this site.
find it amazing yet a bit challenging.
